## Lecture 5. OOP
### Classes
* Defining a class creates a **class object**: supports attribute reference and instantiation. Instantiating a class object 
creates an **instance object**: only supports attribute reference.
*  Class attributes can be written to by the client. No private methods by default.
* You can't overload `__init__`! Use keyword arguments or factory methods. 
* A method is a function bound to an object.

### Inheritance
### Exceptions
